title: Git Logs, Briefer and more Colorful.

This is my first post with a few goals. 

1.
Let's try a picture as well. Here we are with Jekyll-Now, thanks to Github Pages.

Ok, here's the GIT LOG TIP, HT  http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/02/git-log-is-so-2005/

{% highlight bash %}
# Use this cool method
$ git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"

$ git lg
* 7a0922b - (HEAD, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Add value for default variable (9 weeks ago)<Hiroaki
* 920deab - Remove unused files (9 weeks ago)<Hiroaki Nakamura>
* b2870fa - Define task for installing homebrew cask packages (5 months ago)<Hiroaki Nakamura>
* cfc74ad - Add generated with ansible-galaxy init homebrew-cask-packages (5 months ago)<Hiroaki Nakamura>
{% endhighlight  %}

Rudimentary fixes of SCSS. 
At first the syntax coloring was black (dark grey) background, and it did not wrap.
It was not working for me. Its page source showed it was using the expected highlight/pre/code formatters; 
{% highlight html %}
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># Use this cool method</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>git config --global alias.lg <span class="s2">&quot;log --color --graph --pretty=format:&#39;%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset&#39; --abbrev-commit&quot;</span>
{% endhighlight %}

To 'fix' it, which is not a permanent fix, I simply brute forced the top level highlight block.
{% highlight css %}
.highlight {
  background-color: #F8F8FF;  /* GhostWhite #F8F8FF  was  $darkerGray: #222; VARIABLE was $darkerGray; */
  padding: 5px 10px;
  margin: 20px 0;
  overflow-x: auto; /* add these 2 from below  2014-10-28Tue.20:41:22 */
  word-wrap: normal;
}
{% endhighlight %}

List of some of many things left to do just on basic admin :). 
[] Fix syntax highlighting. 
- See that the DarkerGrey, original background, was set in a variable. Search shows this. 
https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=darker&type=Code
- This was the post tutorial I followed, which did not work directly as described. His Jekyll site is manual it seems, not a Github pages one.
http://demisx.github.io/jekyll/2014/01/13/improve-code-highlighting-in-jekyll.html
- That author was utilizing, as a base, this CSS file; 
https://gist.github.com/demisx/8408522
- Nice web colors list for CSS. It has matching tester pages, also, eg to show as background.
http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp
- So far the SCSS I have is here.

[] Add something nicer to the template post that came with the site. 
- I did rename it with leading zeros for the date.

[] Fix datestamp on posts.
- Wish full datetime, not just ymd.

[] Fix login with multiple accounts.
- Maybe need use the non-http but rather git url's. 
https://help.github.com/articles/why-is-git-always-asking-for-my-password/
- This gitconfig is global, definitely don't want that.
https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

[] Redo Git remote to be my own content, so that I can search Github pages of my own on Github. 
- Right now forks are not searchable.
- All by itself that's a good reason to avoid a 'forking install' as described by our BattleSchool hero.

[] Configs; do I care about @Mentions? 
- No, because I have no organization users?
https://help.github.com/articles/mentions-on-github-pages/
- Can I have YMD suffix/prefix on my post names? I like that in URL.

[] Disqus; Add integration.
- Maybe also have multiple users/blogs?
https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions

[] Regular DOCS for Jekyll, Github Pages
- First guide I found, tells that one pages site is free.
https://pages.github.com/
- Basics of manual install.
https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
- Add TOC of Posts. Maybe the Ruby code can help me on formatting, and it looks easy.
http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/
- Gem install jekyll was required today 2014-10-28Tue. However, I didn't run locally yet.
http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/

[] Super duper next steps.
- 2014-08 by Barry, the author of Jekyll-now, tells also how to use own domain, liquid, local building, and ok code hilt.
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/
- 2014-02 Poole is a different Jekyll startup repo. This post tells how to add Archive, Disqus, Google Analytics, Twitter plugs.

[] Can we please in 2014 have live links without gook? Maybe I have to wait for 2015 and a PR.

- OK so here goes trying a link their way: a name=url, text, end-a.

- The above, in final html, keeps 'name', which is unknown, perhaps elsewhere a style by other people.
- OK, fine, lol. Let's use actual HTML.
